    <h1>DOM(Document Object Model)</h1>
    <pre>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents.
         It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
         Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML or XML documents.
    </pre>
    <h1>Why DOM is required</h1>

    <pre>
        DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a tree-like structure composed of objects. 
        Javascript interprets DOM easily, using it as a bridge to access and manipulate the elements i.e javascript can not understand the tags
        in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is essential in web development for several reasons:
        @Dynamic Web Pages
        @Interactivity 
        @Content Updates
        @Cross Browser Compatibilty 
        @Single Page Applications
    </pre>

        Structure Of DOM
        The term structure model is sometimes used to describe the tree-like representation of a document.
        Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects  Event listeners can be added
        to nodes and triggered on an occurrence of a given event.
    </pre>

    <pre>
        Why DOM is called an Object Model?
        Documents are modeled using objects, and the model includes not only the structure of a document but also the behavior of a document and 
        the objects of which it is composed like tag elements with attributes in HTML.

        <h1>Properties of DOM</h1>

        1)Windows Object:Window Object: Window Object is object of the browser which is always at top of the hierarchy. 
         It is like an API that is used to set and access all the properties and methods of the browser. 
         It is automatically created by the browser.

        2)Document object: When an HTML document is loaded into a window, it becomes a document object. The ‘document’ object has various properties 
        that refer to other objects which allow access to and modification of the content of the web page. If there is a need to access any
        element in an HTML page, we always start with accessing the ‘document’ object. Document object is property of window object.

        3)Form Object:It is represented by Form Tag

        4)Link Object: It is represented by Link tag

        5)Anchor Object: It is represented by Anchor tag

        6)Form control element: Form can have many control elements such as text field , buttons , radio buttons ,checkboxes etc
